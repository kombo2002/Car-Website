On our Motorhub website, selling your car is quick and hassle-free. We provide a simple and efficient platform to help you sell your vehicle. Here are the details:<br> 
Vehicle Information: You will be prompted to provide details about your car, such as make, model, year, mileage, condition, and any additional features or specifications.<br>
Pricing and Valuation: We offer a fair valuation based on market trends and the information you provide. You will receive an estimated price range for your car.
Inspection and Verification: Once you accept the valuation, we'll schedule an inspection to verify the condition of your vehicle. This step ensures transparency and builds trust between the buyer and seller.<br>
Listing and Promotion: After the inspection, your car will be listed on our website and promoted across various channels to attract potential buyers.
Negotiation and Sale: Interested buyers can contact you directly through our website or app. You'll have the opportunity to negotiate the final price and complete the sale securely.
